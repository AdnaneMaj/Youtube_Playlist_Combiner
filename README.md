## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (>= 3.6) installed on your machine.
- A reliable internet connection for downloading videos.

   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory** in your terminal:

   ```sh
   cd YouTube-Playlist-Combiner
   ```

3. **Create a Python virtual environment (venv):**

   ```sh
   python -m venv .venv
   ```

4. **Activate the virtual environment:**

     ```sh
     .venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

## Usage

### Download Videos

To download videos from a YouTube playlist, run the `playlist_downloader.py` script:

```sh
python playlist_downloader.py
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to provide the playlist URL and download the videos. The downloaded videos will be saved in the 'downloads' directory within the project folder.

### Merge Videos

After downloading the videos, combine them into a single video using the `merger.py` script:

```sh
python merger.py
```

The script will display the progress of the video merging process and create a final combined video named 'final.mp4'.

### Find the Merged Video

You can find the merged video in the project directory.
